</p>

### Fraud Detection Process
1. **Session Initialization**
   - Generate unique session ID and connection code
   - Store session data in dual Firebase databases
   - Initialize sensor monitoring on passenger device

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - **Gyroscope Data**: X, Y, Z rotation rates (precision: 0.01)
   - **Accelerometer Data**: X, Y, Z acceleration values (precision: 0.1)
   - **GPS Location**: High-accuracy positioning every 50ms
   - **Speed Calculation**: Real-time velocity and movement patterns

3. **Cross-platform Comparison**
   - Passenger device data vs. Bus device data
   - Motion pattern correlation analysis
   - Route verification against planned journey
   - Stop-by-stop validation

4. **Fraud Analysis Engine**
   ```
   Fraud Confidence = Base Score + Speed Variance + Route Deviation + Sensor Mismatch
   
   Thresholds:
   - 0.0-0.2: Legitimate Journey
   - 0.2-0.4: Low Risk - Warning
   - 0.4-0.6: Medium Risk - Minor Penalty
   - 0.6-0.8: High Risk - Major Penalty
   - 0.8-1.0: Fraud Detected - Investigation Required
   ```

5. **Response Actions**
   - **No Action**: Normal journey completion
   - **Warning**: Educational notification
   - **Minor Penalty**: 10-25% fare surcharge
   - **Major Penalty**: 50-100% fare surcharge
   - **Investigation**: Manual review required

---

## 🔑 Additional Features (IPA Generation Solutions)

### 🏆 1. Codemagic (Recommended – 95% Success Rate)
- Specially optimized for Flutter iOS builds  
- Free & reliable  
- Handles dependencies and environment automatically  

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/) with GitHub  
2. Add your repository  
3. Configure:
   - Flutter: `3.24.3`
   - Xcode: `latest`
   - iOS version: `11.0+`  
4. Start build → download `.ipa` from artifacts  

---

### 🔧 2. GitHub Actions (Fixed Workflows – Free)
Three workflows provided:
- **iOS Build (Fixed)** → Recommended  
- **iOS Debug Build** → Troubleshooting logs  
- **iOS Simplified Build** → Lightweight & fast  

**Steps:**
1. Push changes to repo  
2. Go to **Actions** tab → select workflow  
3. Run workflow (20–30 mins)  
4. Download `.ipa` from artifacts  

---

### 🖥️ 3. Local Mac Build
If you have a Mac:

```bash
cd smart_ticket_mtc
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
cd build/ios/iphoneos
mkdir Payload
cp -R Runner.app Payload/
zip -r SmartTicketMTC.ipa Payload/
```

---

### ☁️ 4. Remote Mac Services
If you need a Mac in the cloud:
- [MacInCloud](https://www.macincloud.com/) – $20–30/month  
- [AWS EC2 Mac](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/)  
- [Xcode Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/)  

---

## 📦 After Getting .ipa
You can install the `.ipa` file using:
1. **TestFlight** → Recommended (Apple Developer account required)  
2. **AltStore / 3uTools** → Windows-based sideloading  
3. **Xcode** → Direct install on device  

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes
- **GitHub Actions timeout** → Use Codemagic instead  
- **Pod install errors** → Already optimized, but Codemagic handles best  
- **Certificate/signing issues** → Use `--no-codesign` build  

---

## 📊 Method Comparison

| Method              | Cost        | Time       | Success Rate | Status |
