EMERGENCY SOS CUSTOM ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=============================================

Please save the Emergency SOS illustration image (the one showing a person using their phone on a bus) as:

File name: emergency_sos_icon.png
Location: assets/feature_icons/emergency_sos_icon.png

The image should be:
- PNG format
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
- Square aspect ratio preferred
- Shows the illustration of person with phone on bus during emergency

After saving the image:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`

The Emergency SOS feature card will now display your custom illustration instead of the generic medical services icon.

If the image fails to load, it will automatically fall back to the medical services icon.
