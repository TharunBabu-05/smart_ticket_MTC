## 🛡️ Fraud Detection Workflow

### Comprehensive Fraud Detection System
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Passenger Device"
        A[Smart Ticket App] --> B[Sensor Monitoring]
        B --> C[GPS Tracking]
        C --> D[Data Streaming]
    end
    
    subgraph "Firebase Backend"

    end
    
    D --> E
    J --> E
    H --> M[Fraud Alert/Penalty]
    L --> F
```

### Fraud Detection Process
1. **Session Initialization**
   - Generate unique session ID and connection code
   - Store session data in dual Firebase databases
   - Initialize sensor monitoring on passenger device

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - **Gyroscope Data**: X, Y, Z rotation rates (precision: 0.01)
   - **Accelerometer Data**: X, Y, Z acceleration values (precision: 0.1)
   - **GPS Location**: High-accuracy positioning every 50ms
   - **Speed Calculation**: Real-time velocity and movement patterns

3. **Cross-platform Comparison**
   - Passenger device data vs. Bus device data
   - Motion pattern correlation analysis
   - Route verification against planned journey
   - Stop-by-stop validation

4. **Fraud Analysis Engine**
   ```
   Fraud Confidence = Base Score + Speed Variance + Route Deviation + Sensor Mismatch
   
   Thresholds:
   - 0.0-0.2: Legitimate Journey
   - 0.2-0.4: Low Risk - Warning
   - 0.4-0.6: Medium Risk - Minor Penalty
   - 0.6-0.8: High Risk - Major Penalty
   - 0.8-1.0: Fraud Detected - Investigation Required
   ```

5. **Response Actions**
   - **No Action**: Normal journey completion
   - **Warning**: Educational notification
   - **Minor Penalty**: 10-25% fare surcharge
   - **Major Penalty**: 50-100% fare surcharge
   - **Investigation**: Manual review required
