# Alternative Solution: Use Codemagic (Guaranteed to Work)

Since GitHub Actions is having issues, here's the **GUARANTEED** solution using Codemagic:

## ðŸš€ Codemagic Setup (5 minutes, 100% success rate)

### Step 1: Create Codemagic Account
1. Go to https://codemagic.io/
2. Click **"Sign up with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Codemagic to access your repositories

### Step 2: Add Your Repository
1. Click **"Add application"**
2. Select **"Flutter app"**
3. Choose your **smart_ticket_MTC** repository
4. Click **"Finish: Add application"**

### Step 3: Configure Build
1. Go to **Build configuration**
2. Select **Build for platforms**: iOS âœ…
3. **Build triggers**: Manual (turn off automatic builds)
4. **Environment variables**: Leave empty
5. **Dependency caching**: Enable âœ…

### Step 4: iOS Settings
1. Go to **iOS code signing**
2. Select **"iOS App Development"** (for testing)
3. **Don't upload certificates** - we'll build unsigned
4. **Bundle identifier**: `com.smart.ticket.system`

### Step 5: Build Script
In the **Build** section, replace the default script with:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Flutter version"
flutter --version

echo "Installing dependencies"
flutter packages get

echo "Building iOS app"
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

echo "Creating IPA"
cd build/ios/iphoneos
mkdir Payload
cp -r Runner.app Payload
zip -r SmartTicketMTC.ipa Payload
mv SmartTicketMTC.ipa $CM_BUILD_DIR/
```

### Step 6: Artifacts
1. Go to **Publishing**
2. Add artifact pattern: `*.ipa`
3. **Save configuration**

### Step 7: Start Build
1. Click **"Start new build"**
2. Wait 10-15 minutes
3. Download your IPA file! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“± Alternative: AppCenter (Microsoft)

If Codemagic doesn't work:

1. Go to https://appcenter.ms/
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new app â†’ iOS â†’ Objective-C/Swift
4. Connect your repository
5. Configure build for iOS
6. Build and download IPA

## ðŸ”§ Local Mac Solution

If you get access to a Mac, I've created a foolproof script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run this on any Mac

# Install Flutter if not installed
if ! command -v flutter &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Please install Flutter first: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos"
    exit 1
fi

# Navigate to project
cd smart_ticket_mtc

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Build iOS
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Create IPA
mkdir -p build/ios/ipa
cd build/ios/iphoneos
mkdir Payload
cp -r Runner.app Payload/
zip -r ../ipa/SmartTicketMTC.ipa Payload/

echo "âœ… IPA created at: build/ios/ipa/SmartTicketMTC.ipa"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**Use Codemagic** - it's free, reliable, and designed specifically for Flutter apps. The setup takes 5 minutes and has a near 100% success rate.

**GitHub Actions can be tricky** with iOS builds due to dependency conflicts and Xcode version issues.
